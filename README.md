## Introduction to Robotics


## Robotics Software (ROS2)
ROS (Robot Operating System) was originally created in 2007 at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and later developed by Willow Garage. It was designed to be a flexible framework for writing robot software, providing a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify the creation of complex and robust robot behavior across various robotic platforms.

As robotics technology advanced and new requirements emerged, the need for a more modern, real-time capable system became apparent. This led to the development of ROS2, which began around 2014. ROS2 was designed to address limitations in the original ROS, such as better support for real-time systems, improved security, and enhanced performance in multi-robot scenarios.

ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) builds upon the success of ROS1 while introducing significant improvements. Like its predecessor, it's a flexible framework for writing robot software, offering a comprehensive set of tools, libraries, and conventions. These resources aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

## Path Planning
Path planning is a crucial aspect of robotics, enabling robots to navigate efficiently and safely through their environment. It can be broadly categorized into two main types: global path planning and local path planning.

### Global Path Planning
Global path planning involves generating a complete path from the start point to the goal, considering the entire known environment. This is typically done before the robot starts moving and provides an overall strategy for navigation.

- Advantages: Considers the entire environment, can find optimal paths, avoids local minima.
- Challenges: Computationally intensive, may struggle with dynamic environments.
- Common algorithms: A*, Dijkstra's, RRT, RRT*

### Local Path Planning
Local path planning focuses on navigating the immediate surroundings of the robot, often in real-time. It's used for obstacle avoidance and adapting to changes in the environment.

- Advantages: Reactive to immediate surroundings, handles dynamic obstacles, computationally lighter.
- Challenges: May lead to suboptimal paths, can get stuck in local minima.
- Common algorithms: Vector Field Histogram (VFH), Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)


7. **Dynamic Obstacle Planning**:
   - Focuses on planning paths in environments where obstacles can move or change over time.
   - Crucial for real-world robotics applications, especially in human-populated environments.
   - Key challenges include:
     - Predicting future obstacle movements
     - Rapidly replanning paths as the environment changes
     - Balancing safety, efficiency, and smoothness of motion
   - Common approaches include:
     a) **Velocity Obstacles (VO)**:
        - Represents obstacles in the velocity space of the robot
        - Allows for efficient computation of collision-free velocities
        - [More on Velocity Obstacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_obstacle)
     b) **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)**:
        - Samples the robot's control space (velocities) and simulates trajectories
        - Evaluates trajectories based on clearance, velocity, and goal-directedness
        - [More on Dynamic Window Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_approach)
     c) **Timed Elastic Bands (TEB)**:
        - Represents the trajectory as a sequence of robot poses
        - Optimizes the trajectory in real-time considering obstacles and constraints
        - [More on Timed Elastic Bands](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225063)
   - Often combined with prediction algorithms to anticipate future obstacle positions
   - May integrate with global planners for overall navigation strategy
   - Requires careful tuning to balance reactivity with stability of motion


In practice, many robotic systems use a combination of global and local planning for effective navigation. Here are some key algorithms and concepts in robotics path planning:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: 
   - A graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
   - It is a single-source shortest path algorithm, meaning it finds the shortest path from a **starting node** to all other nodes in the graph.
   - It is a greedy algorithm, meaning it always chooses the shortest path at each step.
   - Guarantees the optimal path but can be slow in large environments.
   - Good for precomputing the shortest path to all nodes in a static environment.
   - [More on Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)

2. **A* (A-Star) Algorithm**:
   - An extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses heuristics to guide the search.
   - The heuristic function is used to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node.
   - Generally faster than Dijkstra's, especially in large spaces.
   - Guarantees the optimal path if the heuristic is admissible i.e. it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal.
   - [More on A* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

3. **Weighted A***:
   - A variant of A* that allows for a trade-off between optimality and speed.
   - Applies a weight to the heuristic function which biases the search towards the goal, potentially finding a suboptimal path faster.
   - Useful in time-critical applications where a good path is needed quickly.
   - [More on Weighted A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Weighted_A*)

4. **RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree)**:
   - A sampling-based algorithm for quickly searching high-dimensional spaces.
   - Nodes are added to the tree by randomly sampling the space and connecting to the nearest existing node.
   - Effective in environments with obstacles and many degrees of freedom.
   - Does not guarantee optimality but can find a feasible path quickly.
   - Unlike A*, RRT can handle continuous state spaces without discretization.
   - RRT scales better to high-dimensional problems where A* suffers from the "curse of dimensionality" i.e., the number of nodes to explore grows exponentially with the number of dimensions in the search space.
   - Better suited for real-time applications in complex, dynamic environments than A*.
   - Often creates a "jagged" path, which need to be smoothed using post-processing techniques in real life applications.
   - [More on RRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree)

5. **RRT* (RRT-Star)**:
   - An optimizing extension of RRT that converges to an optimal solution.
   - Unlike RRT, RRT* includes a rewiring step that allows it to improve the tree structure by:
     - Implementing a "near neighbor" search to find potential better parent nodes for existing vertices.
     - Using a cost function to evaluate and potentially replace edges with lower-cost alternatives.
   - Continues to improve the path even after finding an initial solution.
   - More computationally intensive than RRT but produces better paths.
   - Asymptotically optimal, meaning it will find the optimal path given enough time, which RRT does not guarantee.
   - [More on RRT*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1186)

6. **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**:
   - Not strictly a path planning algorithm, but crucial for navigation in unknown environments.
   - Allows a robot to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of its location within it.
   - Essential for autonomous navigation in new or changing environments.
   - [More on SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)

Each of these algorithms has its strengths and is suited to different types of environments and constraints. The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the known information about the environment, computational resources, time constraints, and the specific requirements of the robotic application.

In ROS2, these algorithms are often implemented in packages such as `nav2` (Navigation2) for general navigation tasks, and specialized packages for specific algorithms or applications.

   - A standardized method to describe the geometry of robot manipulators.
   - Uses four parameters (a, α, d, θ) to define the relationship between consecutive links.
   - Simplifies the process of deriving kinematic equations for complex robot structures.

5. **Jacobian Matrix**:
   - Relates joint velocities to end-effector velocities.
   - Essential for analyzing robot motion, singularities, and force transmission.
   - Used in velocity kinematics and dynamic control of robots.

6. **Workspace Analysis**:
   - Determines the reachable space of the robot's end-effector.
   - Important for task planning and robot design optimization.

7. **Singularity Analysis**:
   - Identifies configurations where the robot loses one or more degrees of freedom.
   - Critical for avoiding unstable or uncontrollable robot poses.

8. **Dynamics Modeling**:
   - Describes how forces and torques affect the motion of the robot.
